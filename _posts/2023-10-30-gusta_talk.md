On 30th of November, we will discuss the disagreement between Ethicists and Long-termists, and it's recent developments. Gustav Šír will have a presentation on the topic, and a discussion will follow.

For an introduction into the subject, see [this link](https://ai.objectives.institute/blog/mapping-the-discourse-on-ai-safety-amp-ethics).
