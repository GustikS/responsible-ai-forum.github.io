In this second talk of our discussion series on [Responsible AI], we will look about half a year back at the open letter(s) calling for a six-month pause in the development of giant foundation AI models, following the release of GPT-4. We will discuss the context, the ethical and safety concerns, and the controversy that surrounded the letter(s), which made the news headlines. Finally, we will discuss what has and has not changed since then in the landscape of development and governance of this technology, and what may lie ahead.

Gustav Šír will talk about the topic from the basics, but if you want an introduction into the subject, see [this link](https://ai.objectives.institute/blog/mapping-the-discourse-on-ai-safety-amp-ethics).
